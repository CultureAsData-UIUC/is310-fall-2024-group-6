## Gloria - Topic modeling and literary texts
**Define Topic Modeling:**
Topic Modeling is a method that identifies clusters of words in large text collections to reveal hidden themes or topics.

**Why this is valuable for cultural data:**
Our project topic is Literature and Texts – Children's Literature. And this method is commonly used in literary studies to analyze themes, trends, or even authorial influences.

**Review & Summarize Selected Scholarship:**

1. Bibliographic Information
Authors: Abdulfattah Omar
Title: Towards Computational Models to Theme Analysis in Literature
Publication Venue: International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications
Publication Date: 2020

2. Computational Method or Cultural Data Type
Method: The study uses **Vector Space Clustering (VSC)**, a lexical clustering approach for thematic classification of literary texts. The data is represented using the **Vector Space Model (VSM)**, where text is processed into clusters based on lexical content.
Transformation: VSM and clustering algorithms _transform the literary text into clusters that group similar themes_, making it possible to objectively categorize and analyze recurring themes.

3. Summary of Argument and Use of Computational Method:
Argument: Omar argues that computational theme analysis offers an objective and replicable approach to categorizing themes in literature, addressing limitations in traditional literary criticism such as subjectivity and limited scalability.
Method Application: By clustering lexical data, the study objectively groups Hardy’s novels and stories according to thematic content. This approach enables a structured thematic analysis of large volumes of text, revealing patterns that may be overlooked through traditional methods.

4. Code and Data Availability:
Data: The study’s dataset consists of Thomas Hardy’s novels and short stories, represented as lexical vectors.
Code: No specific code is provided in the study, but the methods are based on established vector clustering techniques in data science, making it replicable with standard clustering tools.

5. Interest, Usefulness, and Disciplinary Approach:
Interest: The study’s approach to theme analysis is intriguing as it integrates computational and literary methods, addressing both cultural content and computational rigor.
Disciplinary Approach: This study aligns well with Digital Humanities, using data science techniques to advance traditional literary criticism.

6. Potential Use for Group Project:
This study provides a clear framework for using lexical clustering in thematic analysis, which is directly applicable to topic modeling in literary texts. The structured approach to theme identification will be valuable for analyzing recurring themes across a selected corpus in our project.


## Cindy - Social Network Analysis
1. Social Network Analysis (SNA) as a Computational Method
Description: Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a computational method that examines relationships and structures within networks. In this context, SNA can be applied to understand the social interactions surrounding children’s fantasy literature on social media platforms. By using graph theory, where accounts (such as fans, authors, and critics) are nodes and their interactions (likes, shares, comments) are edges, SNA allows researchers to identify key figures or “influential nodes” within these discussions and explore community structures that form around fantasy literature topics.

Why It’s Useful: SNA provides valuable insights into how discussions around children’s fantasy literature spread across social media. It can help identify influential users or fan pages that significantly shape discourse, reveal clusters of communities with shared interests (such as fans of particular series or characters), and highlight the pathways through which popular fantasy books or themes go viral. This information can offer cultural insight into how children’s fantasy literature is received, discussed, and adapted by different demographics and social circles.

Social Media Data as Cultural Data Type
Description: Social media data includes user-generated content and interactions (posts, comments, likes, and shares) on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, as well as metadata (such as timestamps, locations, and hashtags). For analyzing children’s fantasy literature, this data can provide a rich, real-time glimpse into public engagement with the genre, reflecting how readers discuss themes, share opinions, and participate in trends.

Why It’s Useful: Social media data allows researchers to track and analyze real-time reactions to fantasy literature within children’s media, offering a unique lens on cultural trends and community dynamics. By examining popular hashtags, locations of user engagement, and interactions with content related to specific books or characters, researchers can understand how children’s fantasy stories resonate across various groups and regions. This analysis can also highlight how fantasy stories are adapted and interpreted within different cultural contexts, providing insights into the broader cultural impact and significance of children’s fantasy literature.

-Computational Method or Cultural Data Type
The article discusses various computational methods used for community detection in social networks, which is an unsupervised learning task aimed at identifying cohesive subgroups or clusters within a larger network. The authors focus on graph-based methods where the network is represented as a graph with nodes (representing individuals) and edges (representing interactions). The article categorizes community detection methods into several approaches such as graph partitioning, clustering, and label propagation. These algorithms group nodes in a graph based on their interactions, with the goal of finding clusters where nodes are more densely connected within the group than with nodes outside the group.

-Summary of the Argument
The main argument of the paper is the utility of detecting communities in social networks, which has wide applications in fields like marketing, biology (e.g., protein interaction networks), and information dissemination. Community detection can help identify groups with similar preferences or behaviors, which can be used for targeted marketing, recommendation systems, and collaborative research. The paper provides an overview of various algorithms for community detection and categorizes them into different types based on graph partitioning, clustering, and overlapping communities. The authors also discuss the trade-offs between these methods in terms of computational efficiency and the quality of community detection.

-Code and Data Availability
The article does not provide direct links to publicly available code and data. However, it mentions the usage of standard datasets for community detection research and provides references to those datasets. Typically, datasets related to social network analysis, such as collaboration networks, co-authorship networks, and protein-protein interaction networks, are used for testing community detection algorithms.

-Assessment of What I Found Most Interesting and Disciplinary Categorization
What I found particularly interesting about this paper is its broad coverage of community detection algorithms and the detailed classification of methods. It provides insights into how these algorithms are applied across various domains, from social networking to biological research. I would categorize this scholarship as part of the Computational Social Sciences, as it applies computational methods to understand and analyze social structures and behaviors.

-Potential Use for Group Project:
For our group project on the fantasy genre of children’s literature, the community detection methods discussed in this paper could be useful if you're looking to analyze social networks around the genre, such as online communities discussing fantasy books. By applying community detection, you could uncover clusters of users with similar interests in specific fantasy subgenres, authors, or themes.
