# Initial Project & Semester Planning Proposal

## Topic
For our project on children's literature and texts, a primary topical focus will be understanding the representation of specific themes or cultural phenomena within children's books across time or media. Meanwhile will involve exploring emerging trends, such as the rise of interactive digital books or the impact of modern cultural movements (like inclusivity or climate awareness) on children's literature.


**Defining the scope:**
Emerging Trends: Discover and analyze new themes or trends in children’s literature, such as STEM-focused books, climate change awareness, or books that address social justice issues.

**Approach:**
Literature Review: Start by identifying key works and studies in the field to provide a foundation.
Textual Analysis: Examine specific texts and their content, language, and illustrations to evaluate how themes are communicated.
Media Comparisons: Compare representations across different media formats (traditional books, audiobooks, apps) and assess the impact on children's engagement and understanding.
Interviews/Surveys: If possible, include insights from educators, parents, or children on the impact of these materials.

## Materials

## Division of Labor 
To ensure smooth progress, we will assign roles based on group members' strengths and interests, rotating the Project Manager role to maintain balance. Here is the proposed division of labor:

Project Manager (Rotating): Oversees project progress, sets deadlines, and coordinates meetings. Ensures task completion and handles any issues that arise during each phase.

Historical Data Specialist (Francis A.): Responsible for exploring, collecting, and processing the Historical Children's Literature Collection. This includes identifying relevant texts and extracting useful data from scanned images and descriptions. Member 1 will also work on understanding historical context and adding it to the analysis.

Contemporary Data Specialist (Cindy L.): Focuses on processing and cleaning the Children Stories Text Corpus from Kaggle. This includes ensuring that the dataset is ready for analysis, handling any missing data, and ensuring that it aligns with the structure of the historical dataset for comparison.

Data Analysis Lead (Gloria L.): Leads the comparative analysis between the historical and contemporary datasets. This includes conducting a text-based analysis of themes, moral lessons, and cultural representations, identifying trends, and applying data visualization methods.

Literature Review & Contextualization Lead (Lucas W.): Responsible for conducting a literature review that connects our datasets to scholarly sources and class readings. This role also involves providing cultural and theoretical context for the findings, ensuring that the analysis ties back to our research question.

Report Writer/Editor (Yunchae (Sophia) C.): Compiles the findings and ensures that the final report is well-written, cohesive, and ready for submission. This includes integrating feedback from the team and handling any additional documentation, citations, and formatting.

Each member will work collaboratively to support one another's tasks, ensuring that tasks dependent on each other (e.g., data processing and analysis) are completed in a timely manner.

## [Timeline]

***Phase 0: Initial Project & Semester Planning (9/24)***
Plan out a semester-long project. 
Decide on the research topic, area of focus, materials, division of labor and timeline for the project.  

***Phase 1: Literature Review and Data Collection (9/25 ~ 10/9)***
- Literature Review
Read and analyze scholarly sources about children’s literature topics. 
Scholarly sources include class assigned readings and credible scholarly journals. 
Document key findings on group github. 
- Data Collection
Collect historical children’s literature data 
Collect contemporary children’s literature data from Kaggle 

***Phase 2: Mid-Semester Dataset and Documentation Update (10/10)***
Submit the 1st version of dataset and documentation. 
1. Preliminary data collection
2. Initial findings
3. Issues encountered during the process 

***Phase 3: Descriptive Analysis and Data Preparation (10/11- 10/23)***
- Descriptive Analysis: Create statistical analysis using word frequency, sentence length, and publication year. Create visualizations such as bar charts or graphs. 
- Data Cleaning and Organization 

***Phase 4:  Experimenting with Datasets Update (11/14)***
- Choose computational method: possible choice of computational methods are keyword and frequency analysis and sentiment analysis. 
- Apply the chosen method to the dataset. 

***Phase 5: Advanced Analysis and Visualization (11/15-12/1)***
- Continue the comparison of various themes, moral lessons, and cultural representation of literature. Create visualization demonstrating major findings using charts, graphs, and other methods. 

***Phase 6: Demo Data Day (12/10)*** 
- Present the current project progress (key findings, visualizations, and recent version of dataset) 

***Phase 7: Final Report Drafting and Review (12/2-12/13)*** 
- Combine every data into a single report, literature review and data analysis. Include data visualizations and illustrate the research process. 
- Peer review by team members and revise based on give feedback. 

***Phase 8: Final Project Submission (12/16)*** 
- Submit the final project report, dataset, and documentation on GitHub group repository.
