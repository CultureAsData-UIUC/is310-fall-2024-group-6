# Initial Project & Semester Planning Proposal

## Topic
For our project on children's literature and texts, a primary topical focus will be understanding the representation of specific themes or cultural phenomena within children's books across time or media. Meanwhile will involve exploring emerging trends, such as the rise of interactive digital books or the impact of modern cultural movements (like inclusivity or climate awareness) on children's literature.


**Defining the scope:**
Emerging Trends: Discover and analyze new themes or trends in children’s literature, such as STEM-focused books, climate change awareness, or books that address social justice issues.

**Approach:**
Literature Review: Start by identifying key works and studies in the field to provide a foundation.
Textual Analysis: Examine specific texts and their content, language, and illustrations to evaluate how themes are communicated.
Media Comparisons: Compare representations across different media formats (traditional books, audiobooks, apps) and assess the impact on children's engagement and understanding.
Interviews/Surveys: If possible, include insights from educators, parents, or children on the impact of these materials.

## Materials

## List of Materials
-	The Historical Children’s Literature Collection
-	The Children Stories Text Corpus
-	Chat GPT

### Material Analysis
The materials that we need to complete our project involve two datasets and generative AI. The two datasets are one from the University of Washington and another from Kaggle’s Children’s Stories Text Corpus. These datasets align with our topic by giving us a historical dataset and a contemporary dataset. The historical dataset (University of Washington) reflects the biases of the time. This can include biases such as race, gender, and even representation of classes. This dataset can illustrate how only certain classes are perceived and represented. The contemporary dataset shows us specifically the text in children’s literature. This omits things such as illustrations as well as visual and physical aspects of children's literature which are crucial to the storytelling of these texts. When we want to analyze the data of the datasets we are given, using the AI Chat GPT will allow us to see how artificial intelligence can examine and analyze these datasets. This LLM will allow us to note what AI will notice or not notice in its analysis.

When working with the materials to complete our project, the materials that were listed will solely be digital. This means that we will look at different types of children’s literature from a digital format instead of a physical format. This will be data that can either be publicly found from databases, or data that is scraped from existing children’s literature books onto a dataset. From getting this from a digital format, the challenges that I can see arising from this would be finding a good enough dataset. To match the criteria, we would hope that it contained holistic data, meaning that it will have not just the text of the books but also the illustration and physical nuances of it. This is something that we hope to find although it might be challenging to find a dataset that practiced this kind of data scraping. Another challenge that we can see from this is scraping the data ourselves. We would first have to accumulate the data and then find a way to upload it. This could take a while depending on how long we spend on this, but this is always an option that is available. Regardless, proper sourcing of datasets are what we plan on doing with acquiring these materials that can give us the data that we need for our analysis.

## Division of Labor 
To ensure smooth progress, we will assign roles based on group members' strengths and interests, rotating the Project Manager role to maintain balance. Here is the proposed division of labor:

Project Manager (Rotating): Oversees project progress, sets deadlines, and coordinates meetings. Ensures task completion and handles any issues that arise during each phase.

Historical Data Specialist (Francis A.): Responsible for exploring, collecting, and processing the Historical Children's Literature Collection. This includes identifying relevant texts and extracting useful data from scanned images and descriptions. Member 1 will also work on understanding historical context and adding it to the analysis.

Contemporary Data Specialist (Cindy L.): Focuses on processing and cleaning the Children Stories Text Corpus from Kaggle. This includes ensuring that the dataset is ready for analysis, handling any missing data, and ensuring that it aligns with the structure of the historical dataset for comparison.

Data Analysis Lead (Gloria L.): Leads the comparative analysis between the historical and contemporary datasets. This includes conducting a text-based analysis of themes, moral lessons, and cultural representations, identifying trends, and applying data visualization methods.

Literature Review & Contextualization Lead (Lucas W.): Responsible for conducting a literature review that connects our datasets to scholarly sources and class readings. This role also involves providing cultural and theoretical context for the findings, ensuring that the analysis ties back to our research question.

Report Writer/Editor (Yunchae (Sophia) C.): Compiles the findings and ensures that the final report is well-written, cohesive, and ready for submission. This includes integrating feedback from the team and handling any additional documentation, citations, and formatting.

Each member will work collaboratively to support one another's tasks, ensuring that tasks dependent on each other (e.g., data processing and analysis) are completed in a timely manner.

## [Timeline]

***Phase 0: Initial Project & Semester Planning (9/24)***
Plan out a semester-long project. 
Decide on the research topic, area of focus, materials, division of labor and timeline for the project.
