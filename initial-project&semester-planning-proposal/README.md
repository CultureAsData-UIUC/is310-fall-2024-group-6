# Initial Project & Semester Planning Proposal

## Topic
For our project on children's literature and texts, a primary topical focus will be understanding the representation of specific themes or cultural phenomena within children's books across time or media. Meanwhile will involve exploring emerging trends, such as the rise of interactive digital books or the impact of modern cultural movements (like inclusivity or climate awareness) on children's literature.


**Defining the scope:**
Emerging Trends: Discover and analyze new themes or trends in childrenâ€™s literature, such as STEM-focused books, climate change awareness, or books that address social justice issues.

**Approach:**
Literature Review: Start by identifying key works and studies in the field to provide a foundation.
Textual Analysis: Examine specific texts and their content, language, and illustrations to evaluate how themes are communicated.
Media Comparisons: Compare representations across different media formats (traditional books, audiobooks, apps) and assess the impact on children's engagement and understanding.
Interviews/Surveys: If possible, include insights from educators, parents, or children on the impact of these materials.

## Materials

**Division of Labor**
To ensure smooth progress, we will assign roles based on group members' strengths and interests, rotating the Project Manager role to maintain balance. Here is the proposed division of labor:

Project Manager (Rotating): Oversees project progress, sets deadlines, and coordinates meetings. Ensures task completion and handles any issues that arise during each phase.

Historical Data Specialist (Francis A.): Responsible for exploring, collecting, and processing the Historical Children's Literature Collection. This includes identifying relevant texts and extracting useful data from scanned images and descriptions. Member 1 will also work on understanding historical context and adding it to the analysis.

Contemporary Data Specialist (Cindy L.): Focuses on processing and cleaning the Children Stories Text Corpus from Kaggle. This includes ensuring that the dataset is ready for analysis, handling any missing data, and ensuring that it aligns with the structure of the historical dataset for comparison.

Data Analysis Lead (Gloria L.): Leads the comparative analysis between the historical and contemporary datasets. This includes conducting a text-based analysis of themes, moral lessons, and cultural representations, identifying trends, and applying data visualization methods.

Literature Review & Contextualization Lead (Lucas W.): Responsible for conducting a literature review that connects our datasets to scholarly sources and class readings. This role also involves providing cultural and theoretical context for the findings, ensuring that the analysis ties back to our research question.

Report Writer/Editor (Yunchae (Sophia) C.): Compiles the findings and ensures that the final report is well-written, cohesive, and ready for submission. This includes integrating feedback from the team and handling any additional documentation, citations, and formatting.

Each member will work collaboratively to support one another's tasks, ensuring that tasks dependent on each other (e.g., data processing and analysis) are completed in a timely manner.
