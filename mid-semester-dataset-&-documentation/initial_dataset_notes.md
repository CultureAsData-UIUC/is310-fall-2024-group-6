## Notes About Dataset for Documentation
This dataset is a mix of children's literature books from two different archives, the International Children's Digital Library and the Internet Archive Children's Library. The creation of this dataset used Children's books over time and some information is not as specific as others. For example, when going through the archives, you can see that some Date Published has a date range instead of a specific date. This is because in the archive it did not specify when it was published which is mainly on how the data was entered. Another aspect that can be noted is that a couple of these are in different languages. This was to add variety to see how there are different contributors and different books in this topic that we are pursuing. This dataset was made manually where I have all of it bookmarked. Attached are the links to each book:
