## Documentation for Initial Dataset: Children's Literature

**Process and Choices**

This dataset was compiled manually, drawing from two primary sources: the International Children's Digital Library (ICDL) and the Internet Archive Children's Library. The dataset includes children's literature spanning various genres, languages, and publication periods, providing a diverse snapshot of classic children's stories.

Data Collection Challenges: Some publication dates are listed as ranges (e.g., 1865-1889) because specific publication years were not always available in the archives. This reflects the limitations in metadata consistency across archival entries, which impacted the precision of certain data fields. Additionally, books in multiple languages were included to capture the multicultural aspect of children's literature, acknowledging diverse contributions and perspectives.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: We prioritized well-known children’s books that highlight significant genres and cultural backgrounds. Stories were included based on availability in the selected archives, the quality of metadata, and relevance to children's literature themes.

**Content Description**

The dataset includes the following fields:

1) Book Title: Title of the children's book.

2) Author: The author's name (if available).

3) Language: Language in which the book is written.

4) Date Published: The original publication date or date range if the exact year was unavailable.

5) Contributed By: The library or contributor responsible for making the book accessible.

6) Archive: The archive where the book is hosted (either ICDL or Internet Archive Children's Library).

7) Genre: Genre classification of the book (e.g., Fairy Tale, Sci-Fi, Folklore).

This dataset provides a range of children’s literature across genres, languages, and time periods, offering insight into the evolution of children's literature and the types of stories preserved in these archives.
