## Introduction

Our group is exploring **Children’s Literature** as a cultural object, focusing on themes and emotional tones in stories across time. Our research question examines how sentiment and themes in children’s literature reflect cultural values and societal changes. To answer this, we created a dataset of children’s books from Project Gutenberg, combining metadata, textual content, and computationally derived insights. The dataset includes cleaned .txt files with added sentiment and fact vs. opinion scores, designed to reveal underlying patterns in the literature.

## Dataset Demonstration

The dataset is structured with key fields such as Title, Author, Sentiment Score (ranging from -1 for negative to +1 for positive), and a Fact vs. Opinion Score (0 for factual, up to 1 for opinion-based). These fields enable quantitative analysis of stories' emotional tones and narrative styles.
The dataset was created by collecting and cleaning .txt files from Project Gutenberg. Challenges included ensuring metadata consistency across files and transitioning from raw .txt formats to a structured .csv file. The cleaning process involved removing punctuation, correcting inconsistencies, and applying sentiment analysis tools like TextBlob to generate scores.

## Experimentation Results

Our computational experiments revealed that children’s books consistently displayed positive sentiment, aligning with the genre's goal to entertain and provide uplifting messages. Moderate subjectivity scores suggested a balance between emotional storytelling and factual narratives. These findings highlight how children’s literature serves as both a moral guide and an imaginative escape.
Visualizations, such as bar charts, are being developed to better illustrate sentiment distribution and trends over time. This experimentation provided insights into the dataset's potential, showcasing how computational tools can enhance our understanding of cultural practices in literature.

## Reflection and Future Directions

This project highlighted the power of computational methods like Sentiment Analysis in uncovering cultural trends within children’s literature. We learned the importance of careful data preparation and the value of collaboration in addressing challenges like metadata inconsistencies and integrating diverse texts into a single dataset. Future directions include expanding the dataset to include more diverse genres and time periods, refining our computational methods, and creating more advanced visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
While barriers like time constraints and data inconsistencies posed challenges, clear role delegation and regular communication helped us overcome them. This project not only advanced our understanding of children’s literature but also underscored the potential of computational tools in cultural analysis.
