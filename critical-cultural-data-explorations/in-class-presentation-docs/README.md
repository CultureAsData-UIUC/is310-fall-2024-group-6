# Presentation Structure:
## 1. Introduction (1-2 minutes):
Briefly introduce the project and its goals.
"Hello everyone, today we’ll be discussing our project on how AI interprets cultural objects, specifically children's literature, and how it compares to how these objects are represented in datasets. Our project stems from the idea that cultural objects, like books, contain layers of meaning—visual, textual, and historical—that might be lost when converted into datasets."
"We chose two datasets for our analysis: one from the University of Washington’s Children’s Literature digital collection, which focuses on physical books and their cultural significance, and another from Kaggle’s Children’s Stories Text Corpus, a more text-focused dataset containing digitized stories."
"Our goal was to use AI tools to generate descriptions for both the digital objects and the datasets, then compare the two to see what the AI captures, what it misses, and how it interprets these cultural artifacts."
## 2. AI Tools and Methods (2-3 minutes):
Explain how you used AI to generate descriptions for both the digital objects and datasets.
"For this project, we used ChatGPT as our AI tool. It was tasked with generating descriptions of both individual cultural objects (like specific children's books) and the datasets that represent them."
"For example, we asked the AI to describe a typical children's book from the early 20th century. It generated a detailed response, mentioning themes like adventure and moral lessons, as well as describing illustrations, cover designs, and how these books were used to teach values. This was important because it not only showed us how ChatGPT can generate descriptions for our topic, but also how this idea and method can be applied to using AI to generate descriptions."
"Next, we asked the AI to summarize the datasets we used. For the University of Washington dataset, it focused on metadata like titles, authors, and genres. For the Kaggle dataset, the AI summarized the collection of stories but focused more on the text and word counts, rather than the cultural or visual aspects."
"This approach allowed us to see how AI interprets both the richness of a single cultural object and the more data-driven representation of the same object in a dataset."
## 3. Object and Dataset Comparisons (3-5 minutes):
Talk about the main differences in the AI's descriptions of digital objects versus datasets.
Use your GitHub repository to show the generated responses, reading key excerpts for contrast.
"When we compared the AI’s descriptions of the digital object—in this case, a children’s book—with the description of the dataset, we noticed several key differences."
"For example, the AI's description of a children's book from the early 20th century emphasized the visual and sensory details: the vintage illustrations, ornate cover designs, and the cultural context. The AI captured how these physical elements—like illustrations—play an important role in engaging young readers and enhancing the storytelling."
"In contrast, when describing the dataset, the AI focused on technical details—metadata like author names, publication dates, and genre tags. The dataset was presented as a collection of structured information, which is useful for analysis but lacks the emotional or visual elements that are integral to children’s literature."
"This comparison shows how much rich cultural context is lost when you transform a physical book into a dataset. For instance, the dataset doesn’t account for the role of illustrations in shaping how children experience these stories."
"This reveals a key limitation: the dataset can tell you what stories exist and provide some textual analysis, but it can’t capture the sensory experience that a child might have when reading a beautifully illustrated book."
## 4. Gaps and AI Assumptions (3-4 minutes):
Highlight where AI assumptions were made and whether the AI acknowledged missing information.
"Another important aspect we analyzed was how the AI handled gaps in the data and whether it made any assumptions to fill in missing information."
"When describing the datasets, the AI didn’t acknowledge that certain elements—like illustrations or physical context—were missing. It presented the dataset as though it was fully representative of the children’s books, even though key details like cover designs or the relationship between text and images were omitted."
"For example, while the University of Washington dataset includes metadata about the books, it doesn’t include the actual illustrations or cover designs, which are crucial for understanding the full cultural and aesthetic value of these stories. The AI, however, didn’t point out this gap."
"This shows that AI can sometimes make over-simplified assumptions about the completeness of a dataset. It might overlook important cultural elements that are lost in the digitization process."
"Additionally, we noticed that the AI didn't critically engage with the limitations of digitizing children's literature—where visual storytelling and physical context are critical. These elements such as illustrations, page layout, and intractability of tactile storytelling, are crucial elements with children literature. These elements can be lost or diminished in a digital format."

## 5. Reflection on Power Structures and Bias (2-3 minutes):
Discuss how the AI either reinforced or challenged dominant cultural narratives.
"An important part of this analysis was reflecting on how AI-generated descriptions might reveal embedded power structures or biases."
"In this case, the AI's language reflected common assumptions about children's literature—emphasizing moral lessons and innocence in the stories. But it didn’t question whose voices were represented in the dataset or whether certain perspectives might be missing."
"For example, the dataset contains a lot of Western-centric stories, but the AI didn’t mention any gaps in terms of representation of other cultural traditions or voices. It simply presented the dataset as though it was complete and representative."
"This shows how AI might reinforce dominant narratives, such as the idea that children's literature is primarily about teaching morals. The AI doesn’t critically assess whether the stories in the dataset represent diverse voices or challenge dominant cultural perspectives."
"AI, in this sense, can sometimes reproduce existing biases without challenging them. It's important to be aware of this when using AI to analyze cultural data."
## 6. Conclusion (1-2 minutes):
Summarize the overall findings of your analysis.
"In conclusion, our analysis showed that while AI is useful for summarizing and structuring data, it often omits key cultural elements when it comes to children’s literature. In particular, the loss of visual elements like illustrations and sensory experiences limits the depth of the analysis."
"We also found that AI tends to make assumptions about the completeness of datasets, without acknowledging missing information or questioning the biases embedded in the data."
"Overall, while AI can assist with analyzing large datasets, it’s crucial to be mindful of what gets lost in the transformation from cultural object to dataset. It’s up to us as researchers to critically engage with these limitations and understand how much context and nuance is lost in the process."
