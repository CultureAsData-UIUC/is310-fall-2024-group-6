# Instructor Feedback on Experimenting with Datasets Update

## General Comments

Overall, I was impressed by your very detailed README.md, which clearly outlined your process, rationale for methods, initial results, next steps, and individual contributions—very well done! I also appreciated your honesty about the issues you encountered, particularly the challenges with data consistency and file integration.

One area for improvement would be to include more detail in the README about the folder structure. For example, it appears to contain a series of text files, a script, and a CSV file, but it’s not entirely clear how these components fit together. Still, well done on the progress you’ve made so far!

## Specific Feedback

### sentiment_analysis.py

The code works well, and I appreciated your use of a command-line interface. However, I’m curious why the script requires specifying a file name instead of processing all text files in the directory. Making this adjustment would improve the flexibility and scalability of your code.

I also appreciated the comments in the code, which made it easier to follow. As you refine your analysis, it might be worth exploring how TextBlob is making its sentiment determinations. What aspects of the text—such as word choice, sentence structure, or other features—are influencing the results? This deeper understanding could provide more context for interpreting your findings.

## For Final Project Submission

You have a strong foundation for your final project submission. Expanding your dataset would enhance the robustness of your results and allow for more nuanced analyses. Additionally, incorporating visualization code using the libraries you mentioned would help present your findings more effectively.

You should definitely include some of your assessments from your very detailed README, along with the sentiment analysis script and results, in the final submission. I would also recommend bringing in some of your assessment of the peer reviewed scholarship from the *Computing Cultural Data* to help ground your dataset and make it clear how you intended it to be used by scholars in the future. Overall, good work so far, and I look forward to seeing your final project!
