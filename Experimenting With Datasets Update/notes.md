## NOTES

Thes rankings are based on if it is a postive number, then it is considered an overall positive story for emotions. The Subjectivity number is how factual or opinion-based it is based on a scale of 0 to 1. 0 beings facts and 1 being opion-based. These two data points give us more analysis on our dataset and show what rankings are for each Children's story. Something to note is that this is not the original dataset that we used. Although having most of the stories that we were able to decide on, some of these .txt files are different because those were the only ones we could find. These were found on project Gutenberg where we were able to get the .txt files.
