### 1. Purpose of Experimentation
   
*Exploring Data Utility:* 

The purpose is to evaluate how well the dataset captures key aspects of the fantasy genre in children’s literature and its effectiveness in answering the research question. Experimentation helps identify recurring themes like magic, mythical creatures, or heroic quests, as well as trends such as changes in language, diversity, or storytelling styles. It also highlights gaps, such as missing demographic data on authors or underrepresented cultural elements, ensuring the dataset is robust and relevant for future research.

*Informing Future Use:* The experimentation phase also helps you think about how others might use your dataset. By documenting the outcomes of your experiments, you can provide future users with insights into the dataset’s strengths, limitations, and potential applications.

### 2. Method Selection and Application

*Choosing Computational Methods:* Your group will select one or more computational methods that are appropriate for your dataset. These might include text analysis, network analysis, topic modeling, or other techniques relevant to your research focus. The methods you choose should align with your research question and be capable of revealing important patterns or trends within your data. You are encouraged to consult with the Instructor about potential methods.

*Applying the Methods:* Once you’ve chosen your methods, you will attempt to apply them to your dataset. You are again encouraged to consult the Instructor for assistance with applying these methods, as well as using AI chatbots. You will be primarily assessed on your efforts to apply the method, not on the success of your result. This process allows you to test the data’s validity and robustness. You may find that certain aspects of the data need revision, such as missing variables, inconsistent formatting, or incomplete entries. The results of these experiments will guide your next steps in refining the dataset.
